# About

This project is an AI-powered meeting notes summarizer and sharer, built as part of an internship application. It allows users to upload their meeting notes in various formats, automatically generates concise summaries using AI (placeholder for now), and provides easy options to share the summary with others. The frontend is designed with a modern, clean UI and a beige-themed color palette for a professional look. The project demonstrates skills in React, SCSS, and user-centric interface design.
